When I'm in a pub and see a coaster, I don't know if they already have it or not. I could ask them but sometime they don't know either. I don't want to bring them duplicate coaster or bother them all the time (and its nice to surprise them with a new coasters). 

problem scope

- Finds item of interest in a video-feed. 
- Extracts useful data from an item (text, shape, other relevant stuff).
