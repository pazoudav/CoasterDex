Project Idea & Plan
===================

This is the first of three presentations of your project.  Your presentation should include:

- Your project idea.  What you want to achieve ideally and as a minimum, including the operational environment.
- Overview of background material that you have discovered, including previous work (e.g. papers, existing systems), useful software and data sets.
- ~~Live demonstration of code samples that you have tried out.~~
- In what way is your application/method/data different from what is already out there?
- What are the methods that you are considering using?  What options are there that you might need to choose between?
- Initial ideas on how to measure performance (in addition to time).  Having a performance measure can help you compare and select different methods and test your code.

This is a group assignment. 

You can use 10 minutes for your presentation.  Take turns to do the presentation, so all group members take part.
