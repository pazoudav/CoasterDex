# Project Demo 2

This is the 3rd and final presentation of your project.  Your presentation should include:

- Evolution of your project idea and where you are with respect to your goals.
- Results so far:
    - Elaboration of background material that you have discovered, including previous work (papers, existing systems), useful software, and data sets.
    - Methods tested and selected.  Explain the methods that you selected and how you adapted them to meet the needs of your application.
    - Numerical results of your performance measures, and how they evolved over the project.  What changes made the most improvement?  Compare your results to background work.
    - Live demonstration of the capabilities of your system. Show and discuss both success and failure.
- Work involved:
    - Division of labor - who did what. 
    - What has taken up the most time?
    - Particular challenges.
- Conclusions
    - What worked well first-time and what would you do differently, if doing the project over again?
    - Ideas for future work on the project or spin-offs.

We will allocate 10-15 minutes for each group for the presentation.
